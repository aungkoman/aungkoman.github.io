# About Me

Hi, I'm Aung Ko Man, a developer navigating life as a son, big brother, husband, and dad. This blog is where I share my thoughts on code, family, and everything in between.

I write about various topics including software development, Flutter, Android development, web technologies, and personal reflections on the journey of life.
