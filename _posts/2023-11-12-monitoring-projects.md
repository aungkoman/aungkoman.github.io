express.js ပရောဂျက် ဘယ်သောင်ရောက်လို့ ဘယ်ကမ်းဆိုက်နေလဲ သိရအောင်။

# Monitoring an Express.js Project in Production

## Logging
- Implement comprehensive logging using libraries like Winston or Morgan.
- Store logs centrally and use log rotation.

## Error Tracking
- Integrate error tracking services such as Sentry, Rollbar, or New Relic for real-time error reporting.

## Performance Monitoring
- Use tools like New Relic, Datadog, or AppDynamics to analyze and optimize performance.

## Application Metrics
- Collect important metrics using tools like Prometheus or StatsD.

## Health Checks
- Implement health checks with an endpoint (e.g., `/health`) returning a 200 OK for a healthy application.

## Monitoring Middleware
- Use middleware to capture request and response details, e.g., `express-prom-bundle`.

## Load Balancer Metrics
- Monitor load balancer metrics for traffic distribution and potential issues.

## Real User Monitoring (RUM)
- Implement RUM tools like Google Analytics or New Relic Browser for client-side monitoring.

## Environment Variables
- Use environment variables to control logging levels and monitoring configurations.

## Alerting
- Set up alerting based on thresholds and patterns in logs and metrics.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Establish continuous monitoring processes for proactive issue identification.

**Note:** Secure monitoring endpoints and be mindful of performance impact.
