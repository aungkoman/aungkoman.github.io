Yes, there is a standard score that obstetricians, midwives, and nurses use to check a newborn baby immediately after delivery. It's called the **Apgar score**.

The Apgar score is a quick and simple assessment that helps to determine the baby's overall physical condition and if they need any immediate medical attention. The test is typically performed at **one minute** and **five minutes** after birth. If the score is low, it may be repeated at 10, 15, and 20 minutes.

The Apgar score is based on a rating of five different factors, each scored on a scale from 0 to 2, with a maximum total score of 10. The acronym APGAR can be used as a mnemonic to remember the five criteria:

* **A** - **Appearance** (skin color)
    * 2: Pink all over
    * 1: Body pink, but hands and feet are bluish (acrocyanosis)
    * 0: Blue or pale all over
* **P** - **Pulse** (heart rate)
    * 2: Above 100 beats per minute
    * 1: Below 100 beats per minute
    * 0: Absent
* **G** - **Grimace** (reflex irritability)
    * 2: Crying, coughing, or sneezing with stimulation
    * 1: Grimace or weak cry with stimulation
    * 0: No response to stimulation
* **A** - **Activity** (muscle tone)
    * 2: Active, spontaneous movement
    * 1: Some flexion of arms and legs
    * 0: Limp or floppy
* **R** - **Respiration** (breathing)
    * 2: Strong, vigorous cry
    * 1: Slow or irregular breathing, weak cry
    * 0: Absent

**What the Scores Mean:**

* **7 to 10:** A score in this range is considered normal and reassuring, indicating the baby is adapting well to life outside the womb. A perfect score of 10 is rare, as many healthy babies have blue hands and feet (a score of 1 for Appearance) in the first few minutes after birth.
* **4 to 6:** This score may indicate that the baby needs some immediate medical intervention, such as oxygen or stimulation, to help them adjust.
* **0 to 3:** A very low score means the baby needs immediate and intensive medical attention, and they may be taken to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

It's important to remember that the Apgar score is a snapshot of the baby's condition at a specific moment in time. It is not intended to predict long-term health, behavior, or intelligence.
