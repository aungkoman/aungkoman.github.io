We'll develop full note taking mobile app using 
- Flutter  for Mobile App Development
- Laravel for Backend API Development
- Filament for Admin Panel


## Let's start with offline mobile app

### Features 

- [ ] List notes
- [ ] Create / Edit  note 


Just like google keep.

but offline, ultra fast, and light weight.

Just two screens and one button.
- screen one : list of notes
- screen two : create / edit note

Use provider for state management.
so total (3) files

note_list_page.dart
note_detail_page.dart
note_provider.dart

let's create new flutter project and add these 3 files
