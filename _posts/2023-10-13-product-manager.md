When a product succeeds, it’s because everyone on the team did what they needed to do. But, when a product fails, it’s the product manager’s fault.

# Guide to Product Management Basics

In this article, I'll outline the fundamental principles of product management, including user stories, backlogs, and more. If you're new to the field, this guide will help you get started.

## Introduction

I recently convinced several high-performing individuals from various departments within my company to join the Product Management team. Our goal was to tap into their in-depth knowledge of our product to aid in prioritizing the next generation of features. The catch was that they were not experienced product managers and were unfamiliar with the scrum methodology or the role of a product owner. This guide is a resource I created to educate my new team on the essentials of user stories, backlogs, and related concepts.

Marty Cagan's quote from his influential book, "Inspired," succinctly captures the essence of the product manager's role. Writing effective user stories, organizing them into epics, and maintaining a well-structured backlog are crucial for successful software launches and preventing catastrophic failures.

## User Stories

User stories are concise, powerful descriptions of functionality, framed from the perspective of the end user. They typically follow this format:

```
As a <role or persona>, I can <goal or need>, so that <why>
```

For instance:

```
As a <user class>, I want to <perform or do something>, so that <I get some value or benefit>
```

User stories should satisfy specific criteria to be considered "ready" for implementation, with the INVEST framework being a popular guideline:

- **I**ndependent: Each user story should be self-contained, allowing for flexibility in changing requirements.
- **N**egotiable: Implementation details should remain flexible to adapt to constraints and business needs.
- **V**aluable: User stories must deliver value to both the business and the end user.
- **E**stimable: The development team should be able to provide a high-level estimate for the story's implementation.
- **S**ized to Fit: User stories should be manageable within a single sprint.
- **T**estable: Well-defined acceptance criteria should be established before implementation to verify user needs are met.

### Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance criteria focus on the desired outcomes of a user story and follow this format:

```
Given <some pre-condition(s)>, when <some action(s)>, then <expected result/behavior>
```

Pre-conditions are optional. These criteria help ensure the user story is well-defined and testable.

## Estimation

Collaborate with your scrum team to estimate the "bigness" of each user story, measured in story points. Consider factors such as effort, complexity, and risk:

- Effort required for implementation
- Complexity of the work
- Risk or uncertainty involved

Story estimates are relative, not time-based, with a common estimation scale like the Fibonacci sequence. Each user story should be feasible within a single sprint; if it's too large, break it into smaller stories.

### Velocity

After a few sprints, calculate velocity, the average number of story points completed in the last three sprints. This helps with future planning but isn't a measure of performance.

## Epics

For larger projects or features spanning multiple sprints, use epics. Epics are more extensive user stories that group smaller ones, providing a sense of completion when the project or feature is delivered.

## Product Backlog

The product backlog lists all the work to be done, including user stories, bugs, technical tasks, and knowledge acquisition. Keep it DEEP:

- **D**etailed: Ensure items are sufficiently detailed for any team member to work on independently.
- **E**mergent: Be flexible; the backlog adjusts based on team, business, or customer needs.
- **E**stimated: Use story points to estimate size and complexity.
- **P**rioritized: Order user stories based on product priority.

Product managers lead backlog refinement sessions, focusing on making sure user stories meet the INVEST criteria. Invite the whole team, distribute user stories in advance, and keep conversations on track.

## Closing Thoughts

Becoming proficient in these product management principles takes practice and experience. Stick to the process, encourage team participation, and over time, you'll see remarkable results. Best of luck with your backlog refinement efforts!
