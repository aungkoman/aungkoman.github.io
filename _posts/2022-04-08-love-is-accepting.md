### Love is about accepting someone and everything about them.
Relationships should come with realistic expectations. This is real life, not an episode of ```Gossip Girl```.

If you give someone the wrong impression at the beginning of a relationship, they're going to be pretty pissed when they find out you were making something up about yourself. If you tell your new boyfriend that you looooove hiking, and then reveal three months in that you actually hate hiking and only told him that to look cool, you are going to look like an asshole.
