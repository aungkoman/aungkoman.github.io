Is social media wasting your time or stressing you out? Today, I’m going to talk about over 100 things to do instead of social media. 

In a recent article, Why I Took A Year Long Work and Social Media Break, I talked about how I’m spending a lot less time on social media than I used to.

things to do instead of social mediaThis is an area I still struggle with, but I’m doing much better these days. When I think back, it’s crazy how much time I was wasting.

I would wonder where hours of my time went, quite often too.

Since I took my break, I realized that there are so many things to do instead of social media. This has made me more productive, happier, I’m more active, and more.

Now, social media isn’t all bad, and I still enjoy being on social media. I love how it allows me to connect with people around the world, see new things, think of new ideas, and enjoy what other people are doing.

However, it can also cause you to waste a ton of time.

I’ve seen different studies that claim the average person spends hours and hours a day simply scrolling through social media.

And, many people end up with a daily schedule like this:

You wake up and the first thing you do is look at your phone to check Facebook or Instagram.
Then, you may look at it over breakfast.
You check it out again when you get to work.
You scroll through Facebook or Instagram during you lunch break.
Scroll through your feed in between classes (or even in class).
Then again after work.
Before bed.
I know some people who check social media if they wake up in the middle of the night.
Seriously, you probably look at your phone and social media all throughout the day!

So today, I want to talk about tons of different things to do instead of social media.

Many of these same things can apply if you are trying to cut back on your TV watching as well!

If you feel like you aren’t accomplishing your goals or that you are always pressed for time, then you should first analyze how much time you’re wasting each day, especially when it comes to how much time you are spending on social media.

You may not even realize how much time you spend on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and all of your other social media accounts.

Once you realize how much time you may be wasting on social media, I want you to start taking back some of that time and put it to better use!

Whether you want to go full no social media, or if you just want to spend a few less hours, this is the article for you.

Here are over 100 things to do instead of social media.
 

Don’t wake up or go to bed with your phone.
This is something that I am really trying to work on. I am no longer bringing my laptop to bed, but I do need to stop bringing my phone into bed with me. It makes it really hard to stay off of social media.

I know people who put their phone down after a certain time, and don’t look at it again until the next morning. This is something that I think more people should do, including myself!

By changing this simple habit, you may be able to take back control of your life.

 

Learn and experience new areas of life.
Staying away from social media will be hard at first, but it may cause you to try new things and have brand new experiences. You may find yourself trying things you never expected, and many things you’ve always wanted to do more of.

And, there are always new things to learn and experience. There are so many things that you can try that will improve your life, help you grow, and learn more about yourself. Plus, you will never know what you are talented at unless you try some of them. You may even find a new hobby or skill that you love doing.

Here are new things to try and learn instead of scrolling through social media:

Make a new recipe. Are you tired of cooking the same things all the time? Learning how to cook something outside of your comfort zone can be one of the best things to do without social media.
Listen to music and/or make a music playlist.
Listen to a podcast. There are tons of different kinds of podcasts out there, from informative to educational to funny and everything else. Take your pick.
Write in a journal. Taking time to jot down your thoughts can be great for the mind and soul!
Create goals for yourself. These goals can help you grow.
Plan a trip with friends or family. Planning a vacation can take up a lot of time, but it’s fun to research and explore new places. If you want to save money, do a staycation.
Have fun with a coloring book. Yes, there are even adult coloring books!
Go to a museum. When was the last time you went to a museum?
Visit the library. You can borrow books or movies, which you can then bring home and have a fun night in with friends and/or family. Some libraries even lend out state and national park passes, camping equipment, and more.

Learn how to invest. Investing is important because it means you are making your money work for you. If you weren’t investing, your money would just be sitting there and not earning a thing. This is important to note because $100 today will not be worth $100 in the future if you just let it sit under a mattress or in a checking account.

African American women and Asian American women usually earn the most money as there is a larger need for their eggs. This is not easy money, though. There are a number of doctor’s visits, and extracting the eggs requires a medical procedure. For sperm, the average donation pays anywhere from $50 to $100. It can be quite easy to donate, and some men donate as much as 2-3 times each week.

Build better relationships with those around you.
By cutting back on social media, you will hopefully be able to use that extra time to build better relationships with those around you.

So many people simply sit on their phones while eating with friends and family, while out doing activities with others, and so on. Unfortunately, this may hurt your relationships with the people you care about.

But with more time, you can improve the relationships you have with friends, family, and even strangers.

By finding ways to take more social media breaks, you can finally regain your life and improve your relationships. Also, you never know if someone wants you to reach out to them.

Here are things to do instead of social media that will help you build better relationships with those around you:

Call someone you love. A phone call may be exactly what you or someone else needs right now. Everyone texts these days (including myself), but I am working on actually having more phone calls. It’s been weird after years of pretty much no phone calls for me!
Send someone a handwritten letter or a thank you note in the mail. Taking the time to do this can go a long way.
Host a movie night. This is a great and frugal way to spend time with friends or family.
Spend time in-person with family or a friend. You can never have too much quality time. Or, if they are far away, plan a time to do a video call!
Do volunteer work with a friend. You can build a stronger bond with a friend when you work together on something you both care about.
Plan a get-together. Getting everyone together can be a great way to catch up.
Start an accountability group with a friend. You can do weekly check-ins, talk about how you’re progressing towards your goals, and motivate and encourage each other. 
Cook a meal for someone important to you. Whether a friend just had a baby or if you know someone who is having a hard time, cooking a meal can mean a lot.
Talk to a stranger. So many times when we are out in public, we simply just stare at our phones instead of being aware of what is going on around us. Perhaps strike up a conversation with a stranger? You never know who you will meet or how much they would like to speak to someone!
Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoyed this list of things to do instead of social media and things to do instead of using your phone.

Things To Do Instead Of Social Media
Whether you want no social media in your life or if you want to simply spend just a little less time on it, there are many things you can do instead. The internet is a great place, but it can be so easy to waste a lot of your time on the many different social media apps, and feel like you are wasting your day.

Between the many social networks such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Youtube, and more, these platforms can suck so many hours out of your day and cause you to not enjoy your real life.

Spending too much time on social media sites can hurt your mental health as well, and maybe cause you to lose touch with old friends and not be able to make new friendships. It may even hurt your relationship with your kids, or give you fear of missing out (FOMO) in other areas of your life.

Building better routines outside of social media presence can help you to improve your perspective on life, have more meaningful interactions with those in your life, improve your creativity, and more.

How many hours do you spend on social media each day and week? What do you think you could do with a social media break? What other things to do instead of social media do you suggest?
