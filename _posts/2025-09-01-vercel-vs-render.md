hoose Vercel for frontend-focused, serverless applications, such as those built with Next.js, React, or static sites, due to its excellent developer experience, edge network, and rapid deployment capabilities. Opt for Render for backend-heavy, full-stack applications that require managed databases, persistent storage, background workers, and more control over stateful services. You can also use both, pairing Vercel for your frontend and Render for your backend to leverage their respective strengths.
