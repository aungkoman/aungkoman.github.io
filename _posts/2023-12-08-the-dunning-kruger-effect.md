I got fired

I went back home to spend holidays with my family last year
 
Then I got an email from my company after a week 

“Sorry but we have to let you go”
 
Why? I asked.
 
“Since now you’re in country X and we cannot work with you anymore” 

Psst...Slack signed out, Macbook locked.

HR calls me on Whatsapp

"You have to return our laptop or otherwise we sue you and you cannot enter country Y anymore"

"Please give me sometime so I can get a visa and then I will deliver it to you"

"I'm sorry but we don't have much time"

What about my salary? 

"Consider that for the costs we went through for your last visa"

...Drops the call.

Everyone is replaceable, including YOU.

Better be late than sorry, 
start building your own thing.
