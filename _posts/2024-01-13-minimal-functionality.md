Guideline 4.2.2 - Design - Minimum Functionality

We noticed that your app’s main functionality is to market your service, with limited or no user-facing interactive features or functionality. Apps that are primarily marketing materials or advertisements are not appropriate for the App Store.

Next Steps

We encourage you to review your app concept and work towards creating an app that offers customers an engaging and lasting experience that also meets the App Store’s high expectations for quality and functionality. For example, an app for a restaurant should offer more functionality beyond a standard mobile website that include its phone number, address, and hours. You should instead include functionality like table reservations, mobile ordering, etc. that do not currently exist on the mobile website.
