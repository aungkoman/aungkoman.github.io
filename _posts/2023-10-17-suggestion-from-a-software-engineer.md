Programming is not a field but it is an ideology and concept. Most developers in Burma are weak in Programming. What most developers know is only Web Development and Mobile Development. They don’t even know the meaning of “Front-end” and “Back-end”. You can pick one developer from the crowd and ask him what the Front-end and Back-end mean. Most of them will answer like Front-end is JavaScript, React,… and Back-end is PHP, SpringBoot,... That’s the most stupid answer ever. 

Front-end/Back-end is a theory and it exists everywhere. Front-end is something that has to be interactive with the end-user (does not exactly describe that it has to be the Web). For ex: The phone and computer you are using has Front-end part (button, camera, body, color, OS) and Backend (CPU, Memory, battery).

Those JavaScript, React are so-called Front-end Web Development Languages/Framework.

Not every developer can be a programmer. Programming is a concept as I mentioned and Programming Language is a human-readable, compilable language that is used to implement that Programming Concept. 

There are many types of Programming, most developer in Burma do not know. 
Imperative Programming, Competitive Programming, Functional Programming, Parallel Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, etc…

Those Programming style are also a theory/concept.

Most developers in Burma do not even know Maintainability, Scalability, Efficiency of the program. There are many design patterns of programming to improve Maintainability, Scalability and Efficiency. (Here, it comes Software Engineering)

Sidenote: every engineer can be a programmer/developer but not every developer/programmer cannot be an engineer. 

To conclude this question, I would kindly ask to learn what programming means and then review this question again and study those so-called Design Patterns. Those “React, Laravel, JavaScript, etc..” are “အတတ်ပညာ” and those Programming Theory and Engineering are “အသိပညာ”. 

A developer who does not have “အသိပညာ” will not be different from those ……..
