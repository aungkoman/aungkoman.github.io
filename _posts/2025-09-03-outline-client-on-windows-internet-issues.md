When we connect outline client, the windows show No Internet Connection.
We need to reset outline network adapter?


### Method 1: Restart Outline & Reset Adapter

Close the Outline client completely (right-click → Exit).

Press Win + R, type ncpa.cpl → Enter.
This opens Network Connections.

Look for OutlineVPN network adapter (sometimes called TAP-Windows Adapter V9).

Right-click → Disable, then right-click → Enable again.

Reopen the Outline client and reconnect.
