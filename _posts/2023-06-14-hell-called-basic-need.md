Yeah
don't u think we all are in HELL.

Think about finite loop, in which you 

- wake up
- eat
- work
- sleep

That's all

- speak
- walk
- sit
- doing something 

What's all for?
I don't know.
We all don't know why we're here.
What are we doing.
Finally , What's LIFE?

Life is all about sleep, eat and work?
I'm just wanted to know
Still did not find proper answer.

may be religious things will answer ?
